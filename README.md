<h1>Detecting Violent Deepfakes: Dataset and a Compact Attention Network with Multi-Scale
Supervision</h1>
<h4> Overview </h4>
To detect fake and real violent images, a two-channel attention network that uses multi-scale frequency and noise features is proposed. Deepfake Violent Image Dataset (DVID) is also created in this study.

<h4> Dataset </h4>
Dataset will be available on the request.
                                                           
                                                                                       
<h4> Installation  </h4>
The Code is written in Python 3.7. Also, Download and install Anaconda follow steps given in this link:<br>
      https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ <br>
To install dependencies required, Download this file - environment.yml <br>
Use this command to create environment from the environment.yml file- <br><b>conda env create -f environment.yml</b>

 <h4> Steps to recreate </h4>
 To test the model:<br>
 Step 1- conda activate myenv<br>
 Step 2- Download all the files and pretrained weight of the model to a directory. Go to the directory.<br> 
 Step 3- Python test.py<br>
 
<h4> Note </h4>
 The newly introduced DVID dataset and training code will be available on the request.
